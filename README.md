## A demo implementation of ML in a classification problem
 
A simple implementation of ML for breast cancer prediction with Python. The main program also has a demo with a simple web app. Accuracy of classification is not a concern here.

This is an updated clone that runs with Python 3.10.

The dataset is pulled from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apogiatzis/breast-cancer-azure-ml-notebook/master/breast-cancer-data.csv


## Interface with Azure as a web app

The code can be used to run on Azure

## Files

app.py  The main file

breastCancerModel.ipynb  The standalone program to output the model for app.py
